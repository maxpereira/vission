Linear communication is so last century. Vission aims to bring communication into the future, by implementing a node based collaborative system that fosters the organic growth of ideas. The nodemap expands over time as more people join and branch out, continuing a flow of ideas. Our platform was designed for creators who yearn for an easier way to collaborate and find new ideas. As long as you can see the Vission, you can build something that changes the world.

This project is a fork of the hackathon project to continue tinkering with firebase and adding additional features.
